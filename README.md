## Upcoming Features
This is a very rudementary project, but I could add some features to make the gameplay a bit better. A few examples would be:
- Custom sized games.
- Game saving.
- Win condition.
- Better mine information on cell reveal (reveal incorrect flags).
- More animations.
- Better bomb distribution algorithm (no clumps/not too far apart).
